<h2 id="p1" class="yellowBg">About us</h2>
<h3 class="yellowBg">What do we do & why</h3>

<p class="yellowBg">
    Since 1891, we’ve been working for a better future for dogs and the people who love them.  

    When a dog is in distress, we care for them. When a dog needs a home, we find them a loving family. When an owner needs a helping hand (or paw) – or they just can’t cope, we’re ready to step in. 
    
    For every dog, for every owner, we’re by their side through thick and thin, throughout their lives. The bond they have is special to us. It changes lives, making each day happier and more complete. It’s why we believe A dog is for life.® 
    
    Discover who we are, what we do, and how we’ll never stop fighting to make tomorrow’s world a better place for all dogs.

<p class="yellowBg">
    We are a dynamic team of 5 doglovers. Each of us has a long and strong history with our furry friends, both in a private as a professional setting.
    Our passionate and dedicated staff and volunteers have driven our many achievements since then, from changing laws and expanding abroad to supporting thousands of dogs and owners.  
    People have been at the heart of our story since we were founded by Lady Gertrude Stock in 1891. 

    Today, every member of the Dogs Trust family plays an important role. From canine carers and volunteers to our chief executive, we’re all here to help dogs and their owners now and into the future.
